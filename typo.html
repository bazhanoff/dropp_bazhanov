                (This is a sponsored post). Testing is a fundamental part of the
                UX designer’s job and a core part of the overall UX design process.
                Testing provides the inspiration, guidance and validation that
                product teams need in order to design great products. That’s why
                the most effective teams make testing a habit.

            Usability testing involves observing users as they use a product. It

            The earlier you test, the easier it is to make changes and, thus, the
            greater impact the testing will have on the quality of the product.
            A lot of design teams use the excuse, “The product isn’t done yet.
            We’ll test it later,” to postpone testing. Of course, we all want
            our work to be perfect, which is why we try to avoid showing a
            half-baked design. But if you work too long without a feedback
            loop, the chances are higher that you’ll need to make a
            significant change after releasing the product to the market.
            It’s the classic mistake: thinking you’re the user and
            designing for yourself. If you can invest energy to learn
            early and prevent problems from happening in the first
            place, you will save a tremendous amount of time later.
